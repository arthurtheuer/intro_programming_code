Test file for playing around with C functionalities during a coding session, getting used to the main functionalities of the language.

#### <a href="exercise_2-1.c">`exercise_2-1.c`</a> &nbsp; Small programs
First part of the C exercise set, containing small programs.

#### <a href="exercise_2-2.c">`exercise_2-2.c`</a> &nbsp; Array manipulation
Second part of the C exercise set, containing array manipulations.

#### <a href="exercise_2-3.c">`exercise_2-3.c`</a> &nbsp; String manipulation
Third part of the C exercise set, containing string manipulation programs.

#### <a href="exercise_2-4.c">`exercise_2-4.c`</a> &nbsp; Advanced printing
